\page rayleigh Generating a correlated Rayleigh fading process

In this example we will generate a correlated Rayleigh fading process with a normaized Doppler frequency equal to 0.1. The normalized Doppler equals the true Doppler frequency multiplyed by the sampling time (i.e. \f$f_d = F_d T_s\f$). The result is examined in Matlab.

\include rayleigh.cpp

You can use Matlab to examine the channel fading process that is stored int the file \c rayleigh_test.it. Try the followigh Matlab code to view a part of the fading process (make sure that the folder \verbatim it++<version>/matlab \endverbatim is included your Matlab path variable):

\code
load_it rayleigh_test.it
figure(1); clf;
semilogy(abs(chan(1:200)))
\endcode

If you want to look at the power spectral density of the channel fading process, then enter the following line in Matlab:

\code
psd(chan,[],1)
\endcode
