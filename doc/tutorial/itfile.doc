\page itfile Writing and reading data from files

Here we will use the class \c it_file to store some data. The program \c write_it_file.cpp looks as follows:

\include write_it_file.cpp

When you run this program you will obtain a file called \c it_file_test.it in the same directory as the program is located. You can read the file into Matlab to view the data by entering the following lines at the Matlab prompt:

\code
load_it it_file_test.it
figure(1); clf;
plot(a);
\endcode

Make shure that the program \c load_it.m is in your Matlab path and that you run the code above from the directory where \c it_file_test.it is located. 

The it++ program \c read_it_file.cpp that reads the file and prints the content can look like this:

\include read_it_file.cpp
