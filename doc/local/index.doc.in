\section{Introduction}

IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, speech
processing, and communications classes and functions. It has been
developed by researchers in these areas and is widely used by researchers
both in the communications industry and in Universities. Since 2004 IT++
is also being developed as a part of the European Network of Excellence 
NEWCOM (http://newcom.ismb.it/).

The kernel of IT++ are templated vector and matrix classes and lots of
functions for vectors and matrices. As such the kernel is similar to the
Matlab functions. IT++ makes extensive use of existing Open Source
libraries for increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular
the FFTW, ATLAS (or CBLAS) and LAPACK libraries are used.
      
The IT++ library originates from the former department of Information
Theory at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. Since
the library is coded in C++ the name IT++ seemed like a good idea at the
time. While departments come and go, IT++ have developed a life of its'
own and is now released under the GNU GPL license for you to enjoy.

IT++ works on GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows (under Cygwin and
Microsoft Visual C++) and Mac OS X (more testers needed).
