\section{Introduction}


IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, speech processing, and 
communications classes and functions. It has been developed by researchers in these areas and is
wildly used by researchers both in the communications industry and in Universities. Since 2004
IT++ is also being developed as a part of the European network of excellence <a href="http://newcom.ismb.it/">NEWCOM</a>.

The kernel of IT++ are templated vector and matrix classes and lots of 
functions for vectors and matrices. As such the kernel is similar to the Matlab functions. IT++ makes extensive
 use of existing open source libraries for increased functionality, speed and accuracy.
In particular the libraries ATLAS (or CBLAS), LAPACK, and FFTW are used. For more details about these packages
and how to install the see the installation section.

The IT++ library originates from the former department of Information Theory at Chalmers University of 
Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. Since the library is coded in C++ the name of the library 
seemed like a good idea at the time. While departments come and go, IT++ have developed 
a life of its' own and is now released under the GNU GPL license for you to enjoy.
