<b>Do not ask what IT++ can do for you. Ask what you can do for IT++.</b>

You can help us to develop the IT++ library. There are always a lot of things 
you can do:

<ul>
<li> Start using IT++ </li>
<li> Tell your friends about IT++ and help them to get started using
it </li>  
<li> If you find a bug, report it to us. Without your help we can
never hope to produce a bug free code. </li>
<li> Help us to improve the documentation by providing information
about documentation bugs </li>
<li> Answer support requests in the IT++ discussion forums on
SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question, help others to
overcome their IT++ problems. </li>
<li> Help us to improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way
(e.g. that is faster or requires less memory) to implement some of our
algorithms, then let us know. </li> 
<li> Help us to port IT++ to new platforms. If you manage to compile
IT++ on a new platform, then tell us how you did it. </li> 
<li> Send us your code. If you have a good IT++ compatible code, which you
can release under the GPL, and you think it should be included in
IT++, then send it to us. </li> 
<li> Become an IT++ developer. Send us an e-mail and tell what you can
do for IT++. </li> 
</ul>
