Ask not what IT++ can do for you. Ask what you can do for IT++. You can help us to develop IT++ into an even greater library! There are several things you can do to help us out:
<ul>
<li> Start using IT++. </li>
<li> Tell your friends about IT++ and help them to get starded using IT++. </li>
<li> If you find a bug, report it to us. Without your help we can never hope to produce bug free code. </li>
<li> Help us improve the documentation. Send us information about documentation bugs. </li>
<li> Answer support requests in the IT++ discussion foras on SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question,
then help others to overcome their IT++ problems. </li>
<li> Help us improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way (e.g. that is faster or requires less memory)
to implement some of our algorithms, then let us know. </li>
<li> Help us port IT++ to new platforms. If you manage to compile IT++ on a new platform, then tell us how you did it. </li>
<li> Send us your code. If you have good IT++ compatible code that you can release under the GPL and that you
think should be included in IT++, then send it to us. </li>
<li> Become and IT++ developer. Send us an email and tell us what you can do for IT++. </li>
</ul>
