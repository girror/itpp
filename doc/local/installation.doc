\section requirements IT++ Requirements

IT++ should compile without errors or warnings on most GNU/Linux systems
and on most other UNIX like systems like Solaris, Mac OS X, or Cygwin. It
also compiles on Windows NT/2000/XP using Microsoft's Visual C++ .NET
2003 (MSVC++). For Linux, Unix, Cygwin and Mac OS X systems we assume
that you have at least the following GNU software installed on your
computer: 

<ul>

<li> GNU make, version 3.72.1 or later (to check version run <tt>`make
--version'</tt>) </li>   

<li> GCC - GNU Compilers Collection (gcc, g++ and g77), version 3.3.x or 
later (to check version run <tt>`gcc --version'</tt>) </li> 

</ul>

Optionally, you might need additional tools like: Doxygen, LaTeX, Dvips
and Ghostscript to generate the HTML documentation.

We strongly recommend that you use the recent stable releases of the
GCC, i.e. 4.0.2, 3.4.5 or 3.3.6, if possible. We do not actively work 
on supporting older compilers and they may therefore (without prior
notice) become unsupported in future versions of IT++.

In order to use all functionality provided in the IT++ library it is
recommended that you have some external libraries compiled and installed
on your computer. The most important are FFTW, BLAS and LAPACK. To improve
some vector based operations CBLAS is also recommended. BLAS and CBLAS are
included in ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software), which is a
recommended choice. Optionally, binary version of Intel Math Kernel Library
might be used as a replacement of all of these. It is possible to compile
and use IT++ without these libraries, but the functionality will be reduced.
We therefore recommend that you take some time and effort to provide these
external libraries in your system. Please note, that some of them (FFTW,
BLAS and LAPACK) are usually included in the most modern Linux
distributions.


\section download Obtaining the IT++ Source Codes

IT++ is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and hence the
source code of the IT++ library is available for free download. To obtain
the IT++ source code, visit the IT++ project page on SourceForge:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itpp/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/itpp/ </a> </li>
</ul>

and download the file named \c itpp-\<VERSION\>.tar.gz, where \c
\<VERSION\> is the latest release number, e.g. 3.9.0.


\section compilation General IT++ Configuration, Compilation and Installation Instructions

Assuming that you have already downloaded the latest IT++ sources, untar
and gunzip the sources, and enter the unpacked directory:

\code 
% gzip -cd itpp-<VERSION>.tar.gz | tar xvf - 
% cd itpp-<VERSION> 
\endcode

Since version 3.9.0, the IT++ library uses Autoconf/Automake tools for
configuration and Makefiles creation, so the compilation procedure
resembles a standard, well-known GNU method, i.e. 

\code 
% ./configure
% make
\endcode

The \c `configure' command can be invoked with additional switches and
options (run <tt>`./configure --help'</tt> to get a list of them). The
most important are:

<ul> 

<li> \c `--prefix=PREFIX' - set top installation directory to a certain \c
PREFIX value. By default it is set to \c `/usr/local', so <tt>`make
install'</tt> will install the package's files into \c
`/usr/local/include', \c `/usr/local/lib`, etc. </li>

<li> \c `--enable-debug' - switch to DEBUG mode by setting additional
debugging flags used by compiler and linker (disabled by default) </li>

<li> \c `--enable-exceptions' - enable exceptions handling of run-time
errors instead of aborting the program (disabled by default) </li>

<li> \c `--enable-html-doc' - do not generate and install HTML
documentation (enabled by default) </li>

<li> \c `--with-march=CPU' - enable optimization flags for a specific CPU:
\c `i686', \c `pentium3', \c `pentium4', \c `prescott', \c `athlon-tbird', 
\c `athlon-xp', \c `athlon-mp', etc. This option is only used by GCC. 
See `man gcc' for more details. </li>

<li> \c `--disable-shared' - prevent building a shared library (enabled by 
default) </li>

<li> \c `--disable-static' - prevent building a static library (enabled by
default) </li>

</ul> 

By default, the \c `configure' script checks for a few external libraries
used by the IT++ library. These are: FFTW, BLAS, CBLAS and LAPACK. If
these libraries are found in your system, appropriate flags (i.e.
HAVE_FFTW, HAVE_BLAS, HAVE_CBLAS and HAVE_LAPACK) will be defined, and used
during the compilation and linking process.

If some of the external libraries are installed in a non-standard location 
in your system, so they can not be detected by the \c `configure' script
automatically, you might use LDFLAGS environment variable to define
additional directories to be searched, e.g.:

\code
% export LDFLAGS="-L/home/user/lib" 
\endcode

Besides, if the external libraries have non-standard names, you might
specify them to the configure using \c `--with-\<LIBNAME\>' switches, where 
\c \<LIBNAME\> is one of the following: \c `fftw', \c `blas', \c `cblas' 
or \c `lapack'. For example: \c `--with-fftw=-lfftw3' or \c 
`--with-fftw=fftw3' will extend the default LIBS variable with \c `-lfftw3'.

Please run <tt>`./configure --help'</tt> to obtain a full list of \c
`--with-\<LIBNAME\>' switches available.

Although it is not recommended, you can intentionally prevent detection of
some external libraries. To do this you should use \c
`--without-\<LIBNAME\>' or \c `--with-\<LIBNAME\>=no', e.g.:

\code
% ./configure --without-cblas --without-lapack
\endcode

When the configuration process is finished, a status message is displayed. 
For instance, after having invoked the following configuration
command:

\code
% ./configure --with-march=pentium3
\endcode

one can observe something like this:

\verbatim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now type 'make && make install' to build and install itpp-3.9.1 library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\endverbatim

Now, it is time for compiling and linking the IT++ library. To do so,
please simply run the following command:

\code
% make
\endcode

IT++ should compile without any errors or warnings. If this is not the
case, please submit a bug-report on the IT++ project page on SourceForge.
Please include information about your OS, compiler version, external
libraries and their versions, etc.

It is recommended that you check if your library has been compiled and
linked properly and works as expected. To do so, you should execute the
testing process:

\code
% make check
\endcode

As a result, you should obtain a similar report:

\verbatim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `array_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `bch_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `vec_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `vector_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\endverbatim

Finally, you should install the compiled and linked library, include files
and HTML documentation (optionally) by typing:

\code
% make install
\endcode

Depending on the \c PREFIX settings during configuration, you might need
the root (administrator) access to success with this step.

Eventually, you might invoke the following command

\code
% make clean
\endcode

to remove all files created during compilation process, or even

\code
% make distclean
\endcode

to remove all files generated by the \c `configure' script.

\section localinst How to set up a local, dual-config IT++ installation on Linux without being root

This section presents a walkthrough of how to easily set
up an IT++ environment in a "dual-config" fashion, so that one can
compile programs with and without debugging. No need to be "root"; all
files are installed locally.  <p>

The philosophy is:

<ul>
<li>  to locally install all external libraries (lapack, fftw, etc.) from
scratch; this is because we have found that not all precompiled
libraries which come with some Linux distributions, work properly with
IT++ (e.g.  lapack-3.0-3 from Fedora Core 3) </li>

<li> to install two parallel IT++ libraries: one optimized and one for
debugging </li>

<li> to use static linking only (this gives larger executables but is
much easier to use in this dual-config setup as one avoids using the
\c LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable) </li>
</ul>

The installation procedure goes as follows (\c $HOME can be replaced by any directory
where you have write access):
<ol>
<li> Download  itpp-external-2.0.0.tar.gz and  itpp-3.10.0.tar.gz. Save
them in your \c $HOME directory, and unpack them:
\code
% cd $HOME
% tar xzf itpp-external-2.0.0.tar.gz
% tar xzf itpp-3.10.0.tar.gz
\endcode
</li>

<li>
Compile and install the external libs
\code
% cd $HOME/itpp-external-2.0.0
% make distclean
% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/it++external-2.0.0
% make && make install
\endcode
</li>

<li> Compile and install an optimized IT++ library
\code
% export LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/it++external-2.0.0/lib
% cd $HOME/itpp-3.10.0
% make distclean
% ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$HOME/it++3.10.0_opt --disable-debug
% make && make install
% make check >/tmp/chklog1
\endcode
</li>

<li>
 Compile and install a debugging IT++ library
\code
% export LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/it++external-2.0.0/lib
% cd $HOME/itpp-3.10.0
% make distclean
% ./configure --disable-shared --prefix=$HOME/it++3.10.0_debug --enable-debug
% make && make install
% make check >/tmp/chklog2
\endcode
</li>
<li>
 Inspect \c /tmp/chklog1 and \c /tmp/chklog2 and verify that all tests resulted in "PASSED"
</li>
<li> Go to a temporary directory, and create the following 
program \c example.cpp:
\code
#include <itpp/itbase.h>
using namespace itpp;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    mat X = randn(500, 500);
    mat Z = chol(X * X.transpose());
    cout << Z(0, 0) << endl;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cvec a = fft(to_cvec(randn(10000)));
    cout << a(5) << endl;
  }

  it_assert0(1==0,"Debugging was on!");
}
\endcode
Also, in the same directory, create the following
\c Makefile:
\code
FLAGS_DEBUG   = `$(HOME)/it++3.10.0_debug/bin/itpp-config --cflags`
LIBS_DEBUG    = `$(HOME)/it++3.10.0_debug/bin/itpp-config --libs`
FLAGS_OPT     = `$(HOME)/it++3.10.0_opt/bin/itpp-config --cflags`
LIBS_OPT      = `$(HOME)/it++3.10.0_opt/bin/itpp-config --libs`

example: example.cpp
	g++ $(FLAGS_DEBUG) example.cpp -o example_debug  $(LIBS_DEBUG)
	g++ $(FLAGS_OPT) example.cpp -o example_opt  $(LIBS_OPT)
\endcode
This \c Makefile produces two programs: \c example_opt and
 \c example_debug. The former is optimized for performance but offers no
 debugging or assertions. The latter includes debugging info and is
 compiled with all assertions enabled (this generally gives "safe"
 but slow code).
<p>
Run \c make and try the programs
\c example_opt and \c example_debug.  If this works the library is
 ready to use. (The program \c example_debug should exit with an assertion error.)
</li>
<li>
 If you want to conserve disk space, clean up all temporary files:
\code
% cd $HOME/itpp-external-2.0.0
% make distclean
% cd $HOME/itpp-3.10.0
% make distclean
\endcode
To conserve even more diskspace (remove all sources) then do
\code
% rm -rf $HOME/itpp-external-2.0.0
% rm -rf $HOME/itpp-3.10.0
\endcode
</li>
</ol>
 Note: the \c make \c distclean commands in some steps may result in an
error message; just ignore this.  But the command is recommended
because it guarantees that you start with a clean directory, in the
event you would repeat the installation procedure.



\section msvc IT++ Configuration, Compilation and Installation using \
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 and Intel MKL

You need to perform the following tasks in order to compile IT++ with
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 together with Intel Math Kernel Library
(MKL): 

<ul>

<li> Install MKL </li>

<li> Ensure that the Windows' \c PATH variable includes
<tt>"C:\Program Files\Intel\MKL\ia32\bin"</tt> (or the folder where
you have installed MKL). This is required for Windows to find the MKL
dll files. Setting the \c PATH variable can be done via the settings
in <tt>"Control Panel -&gt; System properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
Environment Variables"</tt>. Note that there are \c PATH variables for
both the user and the system, and at least the system \c PATH should
contain the MKL path. Alternatively you can copy all MKL dll files
from <tt>"C:\Program Files\Intel\MKL\ia32\bin"</tt> to
<tt>"C:\windows\system32"</tt> where Windows also will find
them. Restart the computer to make the PATH change valid. </li>

<li> Compile IT++.</li>

</ul>

The next step is to compile your program and link it with IT++ and MKL.
Observe that several things need to be correctly set up:

<ul>

<li> The IT++ include directory must be found. The settings for this
are found in the menu <tt>"Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Projects -&gt;
VC++ Directories -&gt; Include Files"</tt>. Add a path to
<tt>"<IT++ source directory>\itpp"</tt>. </li>

<li> The IT++ library directory must be found. The settings for this
are found in the menu <tt>"Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Projects -&gt;
VC++ Directories -&gt; Library Files"</tt>. Add a path to
<tt>"<IT++ source directory>\lib"</tt>. </li>

<li> The MKL library directory must be found. The settings for this are
found in the menu <tt>"Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Projects -&gt; VC++
Directories -&gt; Library Files"</tt>. Add a path to 
<tt>"C:\Program Files\Intel\MKL\ia32\lib"</tt>. </li>

<li> Linking with IT++ and MKL must be set up. Do this by marking your
project and go to the menu <tt>"Project -&gt; Properties -&gt;
Configuration Properties -&gt; CC++ -&gt; Linker -&gt; Input -&gt;
Additional Dependencies"</tt>. There you need to add
<tt>itpp_debug.lib</tt> or <tt>itpp.lib</tt> depending on whether
debug or release mode are being used. Furthermore, you need to 
add <tt>mkl_c_dll.lib</tt>. </li>

</ul>

Please note that the project settings for your program must be made for
both the `debug' and `release' mode.

=============================================
!!! The following parts has to be revised !!!
=============================================

\section macosx Instructions for Mac OS X

To compile and use IT++ under Mac OS X, you should  install the latest
version of Apple's developer tools. The tools are delivered with Mac OS X,
but you may need to unpack them. Problems have been encountered with
Apple's GCC version 2.95.2 and 3.1. However, with Apple's version GCC 3.3
which can be downloaded from Apple, IT++ has compiled successfully.

BLAS and LAPACK support can be obtained with the \c vecLib framework, but
you must then use Apple's GCC compiler. Hence, only FFTW is then needed to
be installed externally.  


\section solaris Compiling shared versions of LAPACK and ATLAS under Solaris

If you work under Linux, your distribution should ship with static and
shared version of these libraries, it is not the case for
Solaris. When building these libraries from sources, you only get
static \c *.a files. In order to build a shared library, two steps
are required:
<ul>
<li> Compiling the code with the \c -fPIC flag </li>
<li> Building a \c *.so file with the \c -shared flag </li>
</ul>


\subsection sharedlapack Shared version of LAPACK

Edit the \c make.inc file and change the compilation flag to:
\code
OPTS = -O3 -fPIC
\endcode

We don't need a library there, the archive is enough.


\subsection sharedatlas Shared version of ATLAS

When you follow the process described above, you need to add \c -fPIC to
all of the compilation flags:
<ul>
<li> Enter F77 Link Flags  [$(F77FLAGS)]: -O3 -fPIC </li>
<li> Enter C Flags (CCFLAGS) [-dalign -fsingle -xO5 -native]: -O3 -fPIC </li>
<li> Then you can accept the defaults and the summary should be:
\code
F77 & FLAGS: /usr/local/gcc-3.3/bin/g77 -O -fPIC
FLINKER & FLAGS: g77 -O3 -fPIC
CC & FLAGS: gcc -O3 -fPIC
MCC & FLAGS: /usr/local/gcc-3.3/bin/gcc -O -fPIC
CLINKER & FLAGS: $(CC) $(CCFLAGS)
\endcode
</li>
</ul>

One more tip is to edit the \c Make.SunOS_PLATFORM file, check every thing
and modify the \c CDEFS variable :
\code
CDEFS = $(L2SIZE) $(INCLUDES) $(F2CDEFS) $(ARCHDEFS) -fPIC
\endcode

Follow the tips to build a complete \c liblapack.a. Now, we will build the
shared version of the libraries. For each \c *.a (\c libatlas.a, \c
libcblas.a, \c libf77blas.a, \c liblapack.a), do:
\code
% mkdir tmp
% cd tmp
% ar x ../libXYZ.a
% gcc -shared *.o -o../libXYZ.so
% cd ..
% rm -r tmp
\endcode

If you get link error, try to check if the \c .o has really been compiled
with the \c -fPIC flag.
