\section requirements IT++ Requirements

IT++ should compile without errors or warnings on most GNU/Linux systems,
on UNIX systems like Solaris SunOS, and on POSIX based environments for
Microsoft Windows like Cygwin or MinGW with MSYS. It can be also built on
Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP using Microsoft's Visual C++ .NET, but our
support for this compiler is limited. For GNU/Linux, SunOS, Cygwin and MinGW
we assume that you have at least the following GNU software installed on
your computer:
- <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>, version 3.72.1
or later (check version with <tt>`make --version'</tt>)
- <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> - GNU Compilers Collection (gcc, g++
and g77 or gfortran), version 3.3.x or later (check version with <tt>`gcc
--version'</tt>)
.
To perform tests, two command line programs: \c sed and \c diff are
required. Optionally, you might need a few additional programs, i.e.
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>,
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>,
<a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html">Dvips</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a>, to generate the
HTML documentation.

We strongly recommend that you use recent stable releases of the GCC, if
possible. We do not actively work on supporting older versions of the GCC,
and they may therefore (without prior notice) become unsupported in future
releases of IT++.

In order to use all functionality provided by the IT++ library, it is
recommended that you have some external libraries compiled and installed in
your computer. The basic set of them is:
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a>,
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> and
<a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> (version 3.0.0 or later).

Instead of NetLib's reference BLAS and LAPACK implementations, some
optimized platform-specific libraries can be used as well, i.e.:
- <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> (<em>Automatically
  Tuned Linear Algebra Software</em>) - includes optimised BLAS and a
  limited set of LAPACK routines (version 3.6.0 or later)
- <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/mkl/">MKL</a>
  (<em>Intel Math Kernel Library</em>) - includes all required BLAS,
  LAPACK and FFT routines (version 8.0.0 or later; FFTW not required)
- <a href="http://developer.amd.com/acml.aspx">ACML</a> (<em>AMD Core Math
  Library</em>) - includes BLAS, LAPACK and FFT routines (version
  2.5.3 or later; FFTW not required)

It is possible to compile and use IT++ without these libraries, but the
functionality will be reduced. Therefore, we recommend that you take some time
and effort to provide these external libraries in your system. Please note,
that some of them (FFTW, BLAS and LAPACK) are usually included in most modern
Linux distributions.


\section download Obtaining the IT++ Source Codes

IT++ is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and hence the
source code of the IT++ library is available for free download. To obtain
the IT++ source code, visit the project pages on SourceForge:
- <a href="http://itpp.sourceforge.net/">http://itpp.sourceforge.net/</a>
.
and download the file named \c itpp-\<VERSION\>.tar.gz or
\c itpp-\<VERSION\>.tar.bz2, where \c \<VERSION\> is the latest release
number, e.g. 4.0.0.


\section compilation General IT++ Configuration, Compilation and Installation Instructions

Assuming that you have already downloaded the latest IT++ sources, untar
and unpack the sources, and enter the unpacked directory. Depending on the
package type you have downloaded, use the following commands:

\verbatim
% gzip -cd itpp-<VERSION>.tar.gz | tar xf -
% cd itpp-<VERSION>
\endverbatim

\verbatim
% bzip2 -cd itpp-<VERSION>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
% cd itpp-<VERSION>
\endverbatim

Since version 3.9.0, the IT++ library uses autoconf, automake and libtool
for preparing Makefiles and configuration script, so the compilation
procedure resembles a standard, well-known GNU method, i.e.

\verbatim
% ./configure
% make
\endverbatim

The \c `configure' command can be invoked with additional switches and
options (run <tt>`./configure --help'</tt> to get a list of them). The
most important are:
- \c `--prefix=PREFIX' - set top installation directory to a certain \c
  PREFIX value. By default it is set to \c `/usr/local', so <tt>`make
  install'</tt> will install appropriate files into \c `/usr/local/include',
  \c `/usr/local/lib`, etc.
- \c `--enable-debug' - build an extra library named \c `libitpp_debug.*'
  using special debugging flags for compiler and linker (disabled by default)
- \c `--enable-exceptions' - enable exceptions handling of run-time errors
  instead of aborting the program (disabled by default)
- \c `--disable-html-doc' - do not generate and install the HTML
  documentation (enabled by default)
- \c `--disable-shared' - do not build the shared version of the library
  (enabled by default for non Windows based platforms)
- \c `--disable-static' - do not build the static version of the library
  (enabled by default for Windows based platforms)
.
Plese note that each \c `--enable-\<OPTION\>' switch can be replaced
with its opposite switch \c `--disable-\<OPTION\>'.

Since version 3.99.0, a modularization of the library has been introduced.
Therefore, several additional switches have been added to the configure
script, which can be used to disable building some of the library
components. Here is a list of them:
- \c `--disable-comm' - do not build the `Communications' module
- \c `--disable-fixed' - do not build the `Fixed-point' module
- \c `--disable-optim' - do not build the `Numerical optimisations' module
- \c `--disable-protocol' - do not include the `Protocols' module
- \c `--disable-signal' - do not build the `Signal processing' module
- \c `--disable-srccode' - do not build the `Source coding' module

By default, the \c `configure' script checks for a few external libraries,
which might be used by the IT++ library (cf. \ref requirements). BLAS and
LAPACK libraries require a Fortran compiler for linking. Therefore, if no
Fortran compiler can be found, only FFT libraries are being searched.
Otherwise, the detection procedure is as follows:
-# First, the presence of a BLAS library among MKL, ACML, ATLAS and
   NetLib's reference BLAS is checked. If one of the above mentioned can be
   used, \c HAVE_BLAS is defined.
-# Next, some LAPACK library is being searched, but only if BLAS is
   available. Full set of LAPACK routines can be found in the MKL, ACML and
   NetLib's reference LAPACK libraries. Besides, ATLAS contains a subset of
   optimised LAPACK routines, which can be used with NetLib's LAPACK library
   (this is described in the ATLAS documentation). If some LAPACK library
   can be found, \c HAVE_LAPACK is defined.
-# Finally, a set of separate checks for FFT libraries is executed.
   Currently three different libraries providing FFT/IFFT routines can be
   used: MKL, ACML and FFTW. If at least one of them is found, \c HAVE_FFT
   id defined. Besides, one of the following: \c HAVE_FFT_MKL, \c
   HAVE_FFT_ACML or \c HAVE_FFTW3 is defined, respectively.

If some external libraries are installed in a non-standard location in your
system, e.g. MKL in <tt>`/opt/intel/mkl/9.1'</tt>, the \c `configure' script
will not detect them automatically. In such a case, you should use LDFLAGS
and CPPFLAGS environment variables to define additional directories to be
searched for libraries (LDFLAGS) and include files (CPPFLAGS). For instance,
to configure IT++ to link to the MKL 9.1 external library, which is
installed in <tt>`/opt/intel/mkl/9.1'</tt> directory, you should use the
following commands:

\verbatim
% export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/intel/mkl/9.1/lib/32"
% export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/intel/mkl/9.1/include"
% ./configure
\endverbatim

Instead of CPPFLAGS, one can use `--with-fft-include=\<PATH\>' configure
option to set path to header files that provide FFT functionality, i.e. to
\c `fftw3.h', \c `mkl_dft.h' or \c `acml.h'.

In the case that external libraries have non-standard names, e.g.
<tt>`libblas3.a'</tt> for BLAS, you might specify them to the configure
using \c `--with-\<LIBNAME\>' switches, where \c \<LIBNAME\> is one of the
following: \c `blas', \c `lapack' or \c `fft'. You might use
more than one library names by quoting them, e.g.

\verbatim
% ./configure --with-blas="-latlas -lblas"
\endverbatim

If there is only one library specified, you can use a simplified notation
without the preceding `-l', e.g. \c `--with-fft=fftw3' instead of \c
`--with-fftw=-lfftw3'.

Although it is not recommended, you can intentionally prevent detection of
some external libraries. To do this you should use \c
`--without-\<LIBNAME\>' or \c `--with-\<LIBNAME\>=no', e.g.:

\verbatim
% ./configure --without-blas --without-lapack
\endverbatim

It is recommended to set the CXXFLAGS environment variable with some
compiler- and platform-specific optimisation flags, before invoking the \c
`configure' command. Additionally, \c `-DNDEBUG' should be included in the
optimised CXXFLAGS, because it turns off all conditional assertion checks.
This will improve the computation performance of many IT++ functions. For
example, in the case of using the Intel Pentium 4 processor one might employ
the following flags:

\verbatim
% CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3 -pipe -march=pentium4" ./configure
\endverbatim

In the case of Sun's UltraSPARC 64-bit platform and GCC compiler, the flags
might be set as follows:

\verbatim
% export CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3 -pipe -mcpu=v9 -m64"
% ./confiugre
\endverbatim

If CXXFLAGS is not set in the environment, it will be initialised with
the default flags, i.e. <tt>"-DNDEBUG -O3 -pipe"</tt>.

When the configuration process is finished, a status message is displayed.
For instance, after having invoked the following configuration command on a
recent Gentoo Linux system:

\verbatim
% ./configure --with-blas="-lblas"
\endverbatim

one can observe something like this:

\verbatim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now type 'make && make install' to build and install itpp-4.0.0 library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\endverbatim

Now, it is time for compiling and linking the IT++ library. To do so, please
simply run the following command:

\verbatim
% make
\endverbatim

IT++ should compile without any errors or warnings. If this is not the case,
please submit a bug-report on the IT++ project page at SourceForge. Please
include information about your OS, compiler version, external libraries and
their versions, etc.

It is recommended that you check if your library has been compiled and linked
properly and works as expected. To do so, you should execute the testing
process:

\verbatim
% make check
\endverbatim

As a result, you should obtain a similar report:

\verbatim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `array_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `bessel_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `window_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `histogram_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `stat_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\endverbatim

Check if all the executed tests PASSED. If not, please contact us by filling
a bug-report.

Finally, you should install the compiled and linked library, include files
and (optionally) HTML documentation by typing:

\verbatim
% make install
\endverbatim

Depending on the \c PREFIX settings during configuration, you might need
the root (administrator) access to perform this step.

Eventually, you might invoke the following command

\verbatim
% make clean
\endverbatim

to remove all files created during compilation process, or even

\verbatim
% make distclean
\endverbatim

to remove all files generated by the \c `configure' script.


\section macosx Instructions for IT++ Configuration on MacOS X

To compile and use IT++ under Mac OS X, you should install the latest
version of Apple's developer tools. The tools are delivered with MacOS X,
but you may need to unpack them. The configuration procedure is similar to
the one described above.

There is one known problem with configuration on MacOS X. Here is the error
message that might occur:

\verbatim
checking for Fortran libraries of g77... -lcrt2.o -L/sw/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-da
rwin8.4.0/3.4.3 -L/sw/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8.4.0/3.4.3/../../.. -lm -lfrt
begin -lg2c -lSystemStubs -lSystem -lmx /usr/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8/4.0.1
/libgcc.a
checking for dummy main to link with Fortran libraries... unknown
configure: error: linking to Fortran libraries from C fails
See `config.log' for more details.
\endverbatim

We have found out that this error is caused by a possible bug in an autoconf
macro, which is responsible for setting FLIBS used for linking with fortran
libraries. The problem is with "-lcrt2.o", which shouldn't be there.

The known solution is to set FLIBS by hand, e.g.:

\verbatim
% FLIBS="-L/sw/lib -lg2c" ./configure
\endverbatim

or if it does not work, use the FLIBS detected by the autoconf omitting "-lcrt2.o":

\verbatim
% FLIBS="-L/sw/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8.4.0/3.4.3 -L/sw/lib -lm -lfrtbegin
-lg2c -lSystemStubs -lSystem -lmx /usr/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8/4.0.1/libg
cc.a"
% ./configure
\endverbatim

BLAS and LAPACK support can be obtained with the \c vecLib framework, but
you must then use Apple's GCC compiler. Hence, only FFTW is then needed to
be installed externally.


\section localinst How To Set Up a Local, Dual-config IT++ Installation without Being Root

This section presents a walkthrough of how to easily set up an IT++
environment without being root (all files are installed locally). The
installation results in two parallel versions of the IT++ library, one
version with debugging features enabled (this is slow in general but
can be valuable during the development phase) and one version which is
complied with maximum optimization. When compiling executables, one
can then easily generate two versions of a program: one for debugging
and one for maximum runtime efficiency. See the Makefile below for an
example.

The philosophy behind this installation is:
- to locally compile and install all required external libraries (LAPACK,
  BLAS and FFTW) from sources; this is because not all systems
  provide these libraries as ready to use binaries
- to install two parallel IT++ libraries: one optimized and one for
  debugging
- to use static linking only (this gives larger executables but is sometimes
  useful for debugging purposes)

The source code will reside in the directories itpp-external-3.0.0 and
itpp-4.0.0. The libraries will be created in the directories
it++external-3.0.0 and it++4.0.0.

The installation procedure goes as follows (\c $HOME can be replaced by any
directory where you have write access):
<ol>
<li> Download itpp-external-3.0.0.tar.bz2 and itpp-4.0.0.tar.bz2. Save
them in your \c $HOME directory, and unpack them:
\verbatim
% cd $HOME
% tar jzf itpp-external-3.0.0.tar.bz2
% tar jzf itpp-4.0.0.tar.bz2
\endverbatim
</li>

<li> Compile and install the external libs
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/itpp-external-3.0.0
% make distclean
% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/it++external-3.0.0 --disable-shared --enable-static
% make && make install
\endverbatim
</li>

<li> Compile and install the optimized and debugging IT++ libraries:
\verbatim
% export LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/it++external-3.0.0/lib
% export CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/it++external-3.0.0/include
% cd $HOME/itpp-4.0.0
% make distclean
% ./configure --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-debug --prefix=$HOME/it++4.0.0
% make && make check && make install
\endverbatim
</li>

<li> Go to a temporary directory, and create the following program \c
example.cpp:
\code
#include <itpp/itbase.h>
#include <itpp/itsignal.h>

using namespace itpp;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    mat X = randn(500, 500);
    mat Z = chol(X * X.transpose());
    cout << Z(0, 0) << endl;
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cvec a = fft(randn_c(10000));
    cout << a(5) << endl;
  }

  it_assert_debug(1 == 0, "Debugging is on!");
}
\endcode

Also, in the same directory, create the following \c Makefile:
\verbatim
FLAGS_DEBUG = `$(HOME)/it++4.0.0/bin/itpp-config --debug --cflags`
FLAGS_OPT   = `$(HOME)/it++4.0.0/bin/itpp-config --cflags`

LIBS_DEBUG  = `$(HOME)/it++4.0.0/bin/itpp-config --debug --static --libs`
LIBS_OPT    = `$(HOME)/it++4.0.0/bin/itpp-config --static --libs`

example: example.cpp
	g++ $(FLAGS_DEBUG) example.cpp -o example_debug  $(LIBS_DEBUG)
	g++ $(FLAGS_OPT) example.cpp -o example_opt  $(LIBS_OPT)
\endverbatim

This \c Makefile produces two programs: \c example_opt and \c example_debug.
The former is optimized for performance but offers no debugging or
assertions. The latter includes debugging info and is compiled with all
assertions enabled (this generally gives "safe" but slow code).

Run \c make and try the programs \c example_opt and \c example_debug. If
this works the library is ready to use. (The program \c example_debug should
exit with an assertion error.) </li>

<li> If you want to conserve disk space, clean up all temporary files:
\verbatim
% cd $HOME/itpp-external-3.0.0
% make distclean
% cd $HOME/itpp-4.0.0
% make distclean
\endverbatim

To conserve even more diskspace (remove all sources) then do
\verbatim
% rm -rf $HOME/itpp-external-3.0.0
% rm -rf $HOME/itpp-4.0.0
\endverbatim
</li>
</ol>

Note: the \c make \c distclean commands in some steps may result in an error
message; just ignore this. But the command is recommended because it
guarantees that you start with a clean directory, in the event you would
repeat the installation procedure.


\section msvc IT++ Compilation and Installation using Microsoft Visual C++

It is possible to compile and link the IT++ library using the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/">Microsoft Visual C++ .NET</a>
(or Express) compiler and either
<a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/mkl/">
Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)</a> or
<a href="http://developer.amd.com/acml.aspx">AMD Core Math Library (ACML)</a>.

First, you need to install ACML or MKL in your system. If you decided to use
ACML, please download the library built with PGI compiler for Windows, e.g.
<tt>acml3.6.0-32-pgi.exe</tt> file for 32-bit systems. Please follow the
default installation steps of the ACML or MKL installer, except for the
installation directories. For MKL, use the following directory:
<tt>"C:\Program Files\Intel\MKL"</tt> (without version number). For ACML:
<tt>"C:\Program Files\AMD\acml"</tt>. After waiting a few dozens of seconds
you should have the chosen external libraries installed on your computer.
Finally, you should add the directory with dll files to the PATH environment
variable, e.g. <tt>"C:\Program Files\Intel\MKL\ia32\bin"</tt>
or <tt>"C:\Program Files\AMD\acml\pgi32\lib"</tt>.

The next step is to compile and link the IT++ library. Assuming that you
have already downloaded and unpacked the IT++ package, you should find
the <tt>itpp_acml.vcproj</tt> and <tt>itpp_mkl.vcproj</tt> MSVC++ project
files in the <tt>win32</tt> directory. Depending on the installed external
library (ACML or MKL), open one of these project files in the MSVC++ IDE
environment. There are two default targets prepared for compilation and
linking: <tt>Debug</tt> and <tt>Release</tt>. The former can be used to
compile a non-optimised version of the library for debugging purposes,
named <tt>itpp_debug.lib</tt>, whereas the latter one should produce an
optimised library named <tt>itpp.lib</tt>, which is also used by test
programs. Both libraries are static ones and they should be created
in <tt>win32\\lib</tt> directory. IT++ should compile and link without any
warnings or errors.

Last but not least, test programs can be compiled and linked to IT++ with
MKL or ACML by using the project files included
in <tt>win32\\itpp_mkl_tests</tt> or <tt>win32\\itpp_acml_tests</tt>
respectively. The resulting executable test files should be created
in <tt>win32\\bin</tt> directory. Currently there is no automated method for
comparing the output of these test programs with the reference files
(<tt>*.ref</tt>) located in <tt>tests</tt> directory.

To learn how to set up your own project for linking with the IT++ library
and ACML or MKL, please read the following manual: \ref msvc_linking.
