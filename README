IT++ README
===========

IT++ is a library of mathematical, signal processing, speech processing, and
communications classes and functions. It has been developed by researchers in
these areas.

The kernel of the package are templated vector and matrix classes and lots of
functions for vectors and matrices. As such the kernel is similar to the matlab
functions.

In order to use all functionality provided in the IT++ library it is required
that FFTW, CBLAS (or ATLAS) and LAPACK libraries are installed on your
computer. Optionally an optimized Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) can be used
instead. It is possible to compile and use IT++ without FFTW, ATLAS (or CBLAS)
and LAPACK (or without MKL), but the functionality will be reduced.  

IT++ is released under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL).

For installation instructions please read the INSTALL file or the IT++ 
"Getting Started" manual.
