Introduction

IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, speech processing,
and communications classes and functions. It is being developed by
researchers in these areas and is widely used by researchers, both in the
communications industry and universities. Since 2004, IT++ is also being
developed as a part of the European Network of Excellence (NEWCOM).

The kernel of the IT++ library are templated vector and matrix classes, and
lots of functions for vectors and matrices. Such a kernel makes IT++ library
similar to Matlab.

IT++ makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries (but not only)
for increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular BLAS, CBLAS,
LAPACK and FFTW libraries might be used. Instead of NetLib's reference BLAS
and LAPACK, some optimized platform-specific libraries can be used as well,
i.e.:

  o ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) - includes optimised
    BLAS, CBLAS and a limited set of LAPACK routines
  o MKL (Intel Math Kernel Library) - includes all required BLAS, CBLAS,
    LAPACK and FFT routines (FFTW not required)
  o ACML (AMD Core Math Library) - includes BLAS, LAPACK and FFT routines
    (FFTW not required)

It is possible to compile and use IT++ without any of the above listed
libraries, but the functionality will be reduced.

The IT++ library originates from the former department of Information Theory
at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. Because the
library is coded in C++, the name IT++ seemed like a good idea at the time.
While departments come and go, IT++ have developed a life of its' own and is
now released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) for you
to enjoy.

IT++ should work on GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows (with Cygwin or
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET) and Mac OS X (more testers needed).
