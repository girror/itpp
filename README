IT++ README
===========

IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, speech processing,
and communications classes and functions. It is being developed by
researchers in these areas and is widely used by researchers, both in the
communications industry and universities. Since 2004, IT++ is also being
developed as a part of the European Network of Excellence 
<a href="http://newcom.ismb.it/">NEWCOM</a>.

The kernel of the IT++ library are templated vector and matrix classes, and
lots of functions for vectors and matrices. Such a kernel makes IT++ library
similar to Matlab.

IT++ makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for increased
functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular FFTW, ATLAS (or CBLAS) and
LAPACK libraries are used. Optionally an optimized Intel Math Kernel Library
(MKL) can be used instead. It might be possible to compile and use IT++
without FFTW, ATLAS (or CBLAS) and LAPACK (or without MKL), but the
functionality will be reduced.

The IT++ library originates from the former department of Information Theory
at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. Since the
library is coded in C++ the name IT++ seemed like a good idea at the time.
While departments come and go, IT++ have developed a life of its' own and is
now released under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL) for you to
enjoy.

IT++ shold work on GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows (with Cygwin or
Microsoft Visual C++ .NET) and Mac OS X (more testers needed).

For installation instructions please read the INSTALL file or the IT++
"Getting Started" manual.
