===================================
    Test of BCH encoder/decoder    
===================================
A two error case (should be corrected)
input =   [0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
encoded = [0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]
err =     [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]
decoded = [0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
A three error case (will cause decoding errors)
input =   [1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0]
encoded = [1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0]
err =     [1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0]
decoded = [1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0]
