IT++ version 3.10.0                                        Released: 2006-03-??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a final release of the IT++ version 3.10.0. Here is a brief summary
of the new features, modifications and bug fixes since IT++ version 3.9.1
was released:


New features:
-------------

* Documentation improvements: 
  - added a list of features of IT++
  - added first draft of how a Matlab/IT++ conversion table can look like;
    more to be added later
  - verification pages redesigned to include more information

* First version of the	vector/MIMO modulator class added.

* Added support for creating RPM packages using the itpp.spec file.

* Added Newton search optimization routines (BFGS algorithm and
  line-search). For matlab compatibility the fminunc() is implemented.

* Added IDCT implementation based on Intel MKL library.

* Added support for AMD Core Math Library (ACML): FFT/IFFT and DCT/IDCT.

* New Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) algebra class added.

* New blackman() windowing function added.

* Added log() funtion for complex vectors and matrices.

* New modified_yulewalker(), arma_estimator() and yulewalk() filter design
  functions added.

* New polyval() functions for vec and cvec input combinations added.

* Implemented sqrtm() function that calculates the matrix square root for
  real and complex matrices. Based on Octave implementation.

* Implemented Schur decomposition functions for real and complex matrices
  using LAPACK's DGEES and ZGEES routines.


Modifications:
--------------

* Changes in the configuration process. It is now possible to build and
  install two separate libraries: an optimised `libitpp.*' and debug
  `libitpp_debug.*'. The latter one is only build when `--enable-debug'
  switch is used during configuration.

* Removed `--with-march' GCC-specific optimisation switch. CXXFLAGS should
  be used instead.

* Removed limits_test, which was only useful on	32-bit platforms.

* Updated tutorial example programs and their description. Removed
  unnecessary reference files for the tutorial programs.

* Matlab/Octave itload.m and itsave.m scripts are now installed in
  $PREFIX/share/doc.

* Major redesign of the configuration scripts. The following things changed: 
  - checks for BLAS now detect MKL, ACML, ATLAS and reference (NetLib's)
    BLAS implementations; if found, HAVE_BLAS is defined 
  - checks for LAPACK also detect MKL, ACML, ATLAS and reference LAPACK
    library; if found, HAVE_LAPACK is defined 
  - checks for CBLAS detect MKL, ATLAS and reference implementation, however
    CBLAS is fully optional; if found, HAVE_CBLAS is defined
  - new checks for FFT: detects MKL or FFTW3 implementation; if found,
    HAVE_FFT and either HAVE_FFTW3 or HAVE_FFT_MKL8 are defined
  - new checks for <mkl_dfti.h> and <fftw3.h> header files provided by
    external libraries; not using <itpp/base/fftw3.h> any more. 
  It is now possible to mix various implementation of BLAS, LAPACK and FFT
  routines, e.g.: 
  - use MKL's BLAS, reference NetLib's LAPACK and FFTW3,
  - use ACML for BLAS and LAPACK, reference NetLib's CBLAS and FFTW3.

* Added support for look-up table based decoding (in LLR domain) to
  recursive systematic convolutional codes and by the way to turbo codes.

* Statistical norm() functions revised - from now the implementation is
  similar to the one in Octave, i.e. both vector- and matrix-based functions
  accept "fro" argument to choose the Frobenius norm.

* Project files for MS Visual C++ .NET 2003/2005 updated and added.

* Windowing function moved from specmat.{h,cpp} to new files window.{h,cpp}.
  Documentation improved by the way.

* Added zero-padding for fft_real() and ifft_real() functions.


Bug-fixes:
---------

* Fixed a bug in cblas library detection when using BLAS and CBLAS from IT++
  External package on Cygwin.

* Fixed a bug in Makefile.common that caused that an improper
  <itpp/config.h> header file was used during compilation.

* Small fix in the automatic MKL's LAPACK library detection. Now using
  shared libraries `-lmkl_lapack32' and `-lmkl_lapack64' instead of a static
  one by default. 

* Small fix that solves MSVC++ .NET compilation problem (#include <ctime>)

* Fixed bug [1418707] by adding the FFTW_UNALIGNED option to the plan
  creation flags, which allows a standard memory allocation of input and
  output data. This temporary solution reduces performance on processors
  that use SSE and SSE2 instructions.

* A lot of other minor bug-fixes. For a full list of them, please check the
  ChangeLog file. 


===============================================================================
IT++ version 3.9.1                                         Released: 2006-01-28
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bug-fix release. Therefore, no new features have been added
since release 3.9.0. Only minor modifications and bug-fixes have been done.


Bug-fixes:
---------

* Fixed a few test programs that use LAPACK, so now they are robust to
  non-unique results and floating-point precision differences on different
  platforms.

* Protocol sources are now included in the MSVC++ project file.

* Fixed bug [1412383]. The dec2bin() functions appended en extra zero in
  front of the bit vector. This wrong behaviour has been fixed.

* Fixed bug [1399822]. The problem was caused by explicit specialisation of
  some templated operators, when HAVE_CBLAS or HAVE_MKL are defined. In such
  a case, the following forward declarations of explicit instantiations
  (with extern) of these operators should be switched off.

* Fixed bug [1396020]. Now itsave() works properly in both Matlab and
  Octave. Thanks to Jordy Potman for providing a patch.

* A lot of other minor bug-fixes. For a full list of them, please check the
  ChangeLog file.

IT++ version 3.9.0                                         Released: 2005-12-28
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features:
-------------

* Completely new configuration, compilation and installation approach based
  on the GNU Autotools: Autoconf, Automake and Libtool. External libraries
  (FFTW, CBLAS and LAPACK) installed system-wide are detected by the
  configure script.

* Instead of `itpp-config' script, the `pkg-config'
  (http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/wiki/) tool can be used for  linking
  with the IT++ library.

* Implementation of `erf(z)' function for complex argument `z' added.

* New statistical functions `within_tolerance(x, xref, tol)' added.

* New GF2 matrix class added, which is designed for a memory efficient
  representation of binary matrices.

* Polynomials support and filter design functions added.

* Added real Toeplitz matrices using the function toeplitz(mat, mat).
  Generalized also to be valid for non-square matrices.


Modifications:
--------------

* Removed support for libharu PDF generation library. External tools can be
  used instead, for instance:
  - Gnuplot - http://www.gnuplot.info/ 
  - Mathplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  - Asymptote - http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/

* Documentation is now provided in HTML format only. It is generated and
  installed automatically if the following tools are available: Doxygen,
  LaTeX, Dvips and Ghostscript.

* BLERC class improved by adding setup and clear flags and non default
  constructor. Now it is possible to measure BLER for changing block sizes,
  e.g. in an adaptive transmission.

* diag() function now takes a second argument stating which diagonal to fill
  with values (Matlab compatible).

* Implemented feature request [1167378]. An error message is displayed if
  the Parser's init() functions can not open a file.


Bug-fixes:
---------

* Fixed bug [1388024]. `fft_real()' and `ifft_real()' functions now work
  correctly for both external libraries: FFTW3 and MKL. They are also
  compatible to Matlab's implementation.

* Fixed test programs failures due to minor precision differences on
  different platforms.

* Fixed bug [1333897]. The problem with	infinite loop in
  `it_file::seek(...)' function has been solved by fixing
  `it_file::write_data_header(...)' function.

* Fixed	bug [1358858]. Now it is possible to use decode_tailbite() method
  for a punctured code.

* Fixed bug [1358861]. Now the destructor properly deletes the fading
  generators dynamically created.

* Fixed bug [1302350]. Corrected behavior of operator<< in `itpp/itconfig.h'
  when the imaginary part equals "minus zero". 

* Fixed a bug in the oversampling of the OFDM class.

* Fixed bug [1254814]. Added `itpp::' explicit scope for `it_assert_f',
  `it_warning_f' and `it_error_f' functions. Now the macros that use them
  work properly without `using namespace itpp' in the application file.

* Fixed reopened bug [1094934]. Now endianity of x86_64 platforms can be
  successfully detected. 

* Fixed bug [1251878]. `min' and `max' functions did not return indexes
  properly due to the lack of references in functions' arguments.

* Fixed bug [1084246]. Operators and other functions in Vec, Mat and Array
  revised to follow standard C++ conventions. Now operators provide an
  lvalue and also check against self-assignment. 

* A lot of other minor bug-fixes. For a full list of them, please check the
  ChangeLog file.
