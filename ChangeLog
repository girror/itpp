	* itpp/base/parser.cpp, tests/parser_test.cpp,
	tests/parser_test.ref: Fix wrong verbose output of Parser's get()
	function for int and bool types

	When Parser was used to scan an already defined int or bool
	variable and the parsed variable was not found, the verbose
	output was wrong. Here is a minimum example:

          Parser p(argc, argv);
	  int i = 5;
	  bool b = true;
          p.get(a, "a");
	  p.get(b, "b");

	The wrong output of this program was:

	  i = [];
	  b = ;

	instead of:

	  i = 5;
	  b = 1;

	This patch fixes this problem and also improves the parser_test
	program, to detect such issues in future. Thanks to Jia-Yin for
	reporting this problem.

	* itpp/comm/convcode.h: Documentation improvements related to
	encoder state.

	This patch improves the documentation of the encoding and decoding
	functions. Especially, it clarifies why set_start_state() and
	init_encoder() methods have no effect on encode_tail() and
	encode_tailbite() functions.

	* itpp/comm/modulator.h: Improve the documentation of
	Modulator::get_bits2symbols() function

2008-01-31  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* itpp/base/gf2mat.cpp: Fix GF2mat_sparse_alist::from_sparse()
	conversion function

	The conversion function from GF2mat_sparse format to "alist" text
	file format could incorrectly create the "mlist" and "nlist"
	matrices with indexes of non-zero entries. This patch fixes this
	bug and also improves the conversion speed by using the
	get_nz_indices() function from Sparse_Vec class and set_row()
	instead of append_row() where possible.

2008-01-23  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, VERSION, autogen.sh: Optionally append SVN revision
	to IT++ package version

	When bootstrapping IT++ sources from SVN or Git repositories
	append the SVN revision number to the package version string. This
	feature is triggered by including the additional "svn" keyword in
	at the end of the first line of the VERSION file.

	BTW, remove snapshot and snapshot-html top Makefile's targets.

	* tests/poly_test.cpp, tests/poly_test.ref, tests/window_test.cpp,
	tests/window_test.ref: Change cout format to "fixed" and
	workaround precision problem on MinGW

	With this change, we can get rid of round_to_zero() workaround
	functions preventing precision differences when using MinGW. BTW,
	limit precision to 6 in poly_test to workaround precision problems
	when using MinGW/MSYS.

	* itpp/signal/poly.cpp: Add missing include file required when
	using MSVC++

	Without including itpp/base/math/trig_hyp.h, ::acosh() function is
	undefined under MSVC++.

2008-01-17  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac.in, itpp/Makefile.am: Fix improper default shared
	and static settings

	Besides, do not add "-no-undefined" libtool switch to global
	LDFLAGS. Use NO_UNDEFINED substituted variable instead.

	* itpp/signal/window.cpp, itpp/signal/window.h,
	tests/window_test.cpp, tests/window_test.ref: Add Dolph-Chebyshev
	window

	Add the chebwin() function to evaluate the coefficients of the
	Dolph-Chebyshev window. Testing routines implemented as well.

	The tests check the values output by the Dolph-Chebyshev window
	function for lengths 32 and 33 for 50 dB suppression and for
	lengths 127 and 128 at 25 dB suppression.

	Thanks to Kumar Appaiah for providing and improving the patches.
	This commit closes feature request [1869927].

	* itpp/signal/poly.cpp, itpp/signal/poly.h, tests/poly_test.cpp,
	tests/poly_test.ref: Add cheb() functions - first order Chebyshev
	polynomial

	The cheb() functions evaluates a first order Chebyshev polynomial
	at a specific point (or set of points in a vector/matrix). Also
	add a simple set of tests for the cheb() functions, and regenerate
	the reference results to match the new format output in fixed
	format.

	Thanks to Kumar Appaiah for providing and improving the initial
	patches from feature request [1869927].

2008-01-06  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* itpp/base/math/log_exp.h: Fix bug [1863940] in log_add()
	function for infinite arguments

	When both arguments of log_add() function were either inf or -inf,
	the result was NaN instead of +/-inf. This patch fixes this issue.

2008-01-04  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* itpp/base/math/misc.h: Add missing itpp namespace description

	Without this patch, Doxygen 1.5.4 did not generate any
	documentation for the itpp namespace.

2008-01-01  Adam Piatyszek  <ediap@users.sourceforge.net>

	* License change: GPLv2 -> GPLv3

	BTW, update Copyright years to `1995-2008'

	* configure.ac.in: Add support for building a DLL library on
	Cygwin

	When libblas and liblapack are installed from Cygwin repository,
	it is possible to build IT++ as a DLL library. This requires
	"-no-undefined" flag to be passed to the linker.
