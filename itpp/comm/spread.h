  \brief Spreading of float symbols to float output

  Spreading block for generation of 1-dimensional DS-CDMA signals
  Useful in the simulation of DS-CDMA systems on chip level or upsampled chip level.

  Obeserve that the spreading is
  normalized so that the energy per bit is preserved before and after spreading
  (that is each symbol is multiplied with \c 1/sqrt(N)).
  Hence, for the multicode case the energy is normalized for one symbol
  (code) but the transmitted signal consist of a sum of several signals.

  Four different classes exist:

  <ul>
  <li> Spread_1d for 1-dimensional symbols (e.g. BPSK).</li>
  <li> Spread_2d for 2-dimensional symbols (e.g. QPSK).</li>
  </ul>

  For multicode transmission, that is each user uses several codes in parallel to transmit data, there exist

  <ul>
  <li> Multicode_Spread_1d for 1-dimensional symbols. </li>
  <li> Multicode_Spread_2d for 2-dimensional symbols. </li>
  </ul>

  Example:
  \code
  #include "itpp/itcomm.h"

  int main() {

  //Generate the spreading code you want to use.
  vec spreading_code = "-1 1 -1 1";

  //Initiate th Spreading class
  Spread_1d spread_1d(spreading_code);

  //Generate the symbols to transmitt
  bvec transmitted_bits = randb(10);
  BPSK bpsk;
  vec transmitted_symbols = bpsk.modulate_bits(transmitted_bits);

  //Spread the symbols
  vec transmitted_signal = spread_1d.spread(transmitted_symbols);

  //Generate the received signal
  vec received_signal = transmitted_signal;

  //Despread the received signal
  vec received_symbols  = spread_1d.despread(received_signal,0);

  //demodulate the bits
  bvec received_bits = bpsk.demodulate_bits(received_symbols);

  }
  \endcode

  \brief Spreading of complex symbols to complex output.

  The spreading are done independently for the I and Q phases. That is
  real(symbols) are spread by the incodeI and imag(symbols) are spread
  by incodeQ.

  Before despreading the phase should be corrected, that is the
  complex baseband signal should be multiplied by exp(j*PHIk), where
  PHIk is the phase of that user (and path).
