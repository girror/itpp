The \c n size Hamming window is a vector \f$w\f$ where the \f$i\f$th component is
\f[
w_i = 0.54 - 0.46 \cos(2\pi i/(n-1))

The \c n size Hanning window is a vector \f$w\f$ where the \f$i\f$th component is
\f[
w_i = 0.5(1 - \cos(2\pi (i+1)/(n+1))
\f]

Observe that this function is not the same as the hann() function which is defined
as in matlab.

  \brief Dolph-Chebyshev window

  The length \c n Dolph-Chebyshev window is a vector \f$w\f$ whose \f$i\f$th
  transform component is given by
  \f[
  W[k] = \frac{T_M\left(\beta \cos\left(\frac{\pi k}{M}\right)
  \right)}{T_M(\beta)},k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, M - 1

  where \c T_n(x) is the order \c n Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

  \param n length of the Doplh-Chebyshev window
  \param at attenutation of side lobe (in dB)
  \return symmetric length \c n Doplh-Chebyshev window
