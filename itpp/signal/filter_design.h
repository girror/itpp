  \brief Frequency response of filter
  \ingroup filters
  \author Tony Ottosson

  Calculates the N-point frequency response of the supplied digital filter over the frequencies w.
  If w is not given the response is evaluated over the range 0 to \f$\pi\f$ with N values.
  The default value of N is 512.

  If \c w is supplied polyval() is used. Otherwise the calculation is based on the fft.

  \brief Calculate autocorrelation from the specified frequency-response (suitable for filter design)
  \ingroup filters
  \author Tony Ottosson

  Calculates the autocorrelation function of size \c N corresponding to the specified frequency response.
  Useful as a first step in designing filters.

  The vectors \c f and \c m is the frequency response. The frequencies should be between 0 and 1.0
  (equal to half the sample rate) in increasing order. Both 0.0 and 1.0 must be included. The frequency
  response is upsampled to 512 points and the autocorrelation is ifft of the power
  magnitude response of the upsampled frequency response.

  \brief Estimation of AR-part in an ARMA model given the autocorrelation
  \ingroup filters
  \author Tony Ottosson

  Estimates the AR-part of an ARMA model from the given autocorrelation. The AR part is of order \c n.
  The overdetermined modified Yule-Walker equations are used.

  If \f$N>n\f$ then the system is overdetermined and a least squares solution is used.
  As a rule of thumb use \f$N = 4 n\f$

  The parameter \c m is the order of the MA-part such that \f$R(k) = 0, \forall \|k\| > m\f$.

  The supplied autocorrelation should at least be of size \c N.

/*!
  \brief Estimation of ARMA model given the autocorrelation
  \ingroup filters
  \author Tony Ottosson

  Estimates an ARMA model from the given autocorrelation. The AR part is of order \c n and the MA part
  is of order \c m.

  The AR part (the denominator) is calcuated using the modified Yule-Walker equations. The
  the MA part (the nominator) is calculated by calculating the inverse magnitude spectrum using FFTs of
  size 512 which is an AR-system. This AR-system is then solved using the Levinson-Durbin algorithm.

  The supplied autocorrelation is windowed using a Hamming window of size \f$2(m+n)\f$ and hence should at
  least be of that size.

  \brief ARMA filter design using a least-squares fit to the specified frequency-response
  \ingroup filters
  \author Tony Ottosson

  The arma_estimator() function is used to calculate the a and b coefficients.

  The vectors \c f and \c m is the frequency response. The frequencies should be between 0 and 1.0
  (equal to half the sample rate) in increasing order. Both 0.0 and 1.0 must be included. The
  filter_design_autocorrelation() fucnction is used to interpolate the frequency response and calculate
  the corresponding autocorrelation.

  Observe: this function will not always give exactly the same result as the matlab yulewalk function.
