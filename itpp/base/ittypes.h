  This platform uses different sizes for "short" and "int" standard	\
  types than expected 2 and 4 bytes, respectively. This causes		\
  incompatibilities of some parts of IT++ with most of 32- and 64-bit	\
  platforms. Especially binary I/O operations will be incompatible.	\
  Please report this problem to IT++ developers. If you are OK with it	\
  you can add "-DNO_INT_SIZE_CHECK" to your CPPFLAGS and recompile the	\
  library.
