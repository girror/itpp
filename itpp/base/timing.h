  \brief A CPU time timer class
  \ingroup timers

  Measures the time spent by the CPU on the current process.  If two processes
  are running concurrently, one real seconds equal 5 CPU seconds per process.
  The resolution is not very good (in the order of 0.01 seconds).
  
  Usage: Define a time object:
  \code
  CPU_Timer timer;
  \endcode
  
  Actions:
  Reset: \code timer.reset(); \endcode
  Start: \code timer.start(); \endcode
  Stop: \code timer.stop(); \endcode
  Get time: \code elapsedtime = timer.get_time(); \endcode

  It is possible to get elapsed time without stopping the timer.
  Observe that it is also possible to use the macros "time.tic();"
  to reset and start clock and "time.toc();" stop and print the elapsed time.
  \warning May give an negative answer if the measured time is too long.
