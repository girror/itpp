/*
 * Evaluate polynomial
 *
 * int N;
 * double x, y, coef[N+1], polevl[];
 *
 * y = polevl( x, coef, N );
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Evaluates polynomial of degree N:
 *
 *                     2          N
 * y  =  C  + C x + C x  +...+ C x
 *        0    1     2          N
 *
 * Coefficients are stored in reverse order:
 *
 * coef[0] = C  , ..., coef[N] = C  .
 *            N                   0
 *
 *  The function p1evl() assumes that coef[N] = 1.0 and is
 * omitted from the array.  Its calling arguments are
 * otherwise the same as polevl().
 *
 * SPEED:
 *
 * In the interest of speed, there are no checks for out
 * of bounds arithmetic.  This routine is used by most of
 * the functions in the library.  Depending on available
 * equipment features, the user may wish to rewrite the
 * program in microcode or assembly language.
