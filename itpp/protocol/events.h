  \brief Event Queue class

  A class for storing and executing events. Events can be added to the queue and when the start() is
  called all events will be executed. Observe that Events need to be created before they are added to the
  queue by calling an appropriate constructor. However, expired events are destroyed automatically (the destructor is called).
