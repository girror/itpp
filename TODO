Things to fix before releasing version 4.0.0
============================================

Feature enhancements:
---------------------

* Multi-dimensional arrays.

* Script for testfiles on Visual C++ .NET.

* Update random number generator. Seed initialization and license.

* Add the Simulation_Admin class from Hakan Eriksson

* Add the Simulation Manager from Fredrik Malmsten???

* Add Array<T>::mid(start, nrof_elem), Array<T>::left(nrof_elem),
  Array<T>::right(nrof_elem) (Pal Frenger)

* Add cout for Sparse_Vec and Sparse_Mat (Pal)

* Add optimization routines: 
  - Use GSL for fminbnd (brent) and fminunc (BFGS).  
  - Add other routines from http://plato.asu.edu/guide.html and
    http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/glopt.html - LP, SDP, SOCP, ...  
  - Make a Optimize class.

* Compression in it-file format??? Difficult to read in matlab???


Bug fixes and Internal fixes:
-----------------------------

* Remove the function mult_trans in src/base/smat.cpp?

* Check the fastmath functions. It seems like they are not any faster
  than the ordinary math functions.

* The member functions in needs to be revised. The "<<" functions does
  not always match the ">>" functions.

* Improve the functionality of the Vec::set(char*) and Mat::set(char*)
  members. The current implementation does not allow newlines, tabs,
  etc. Complex numbers should also be supported.



COMPILER support
================

* SUN CC compiler?

* Intel C++ compiler?


AUDIO
===== 

* Remove audiodev and audiofile. Replace with another audiolibrary
  that is more transparent. Use libsndfile
  (http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/)?


IT-FILE
=======

* Modify it-file so that a description field and comment fields are
  added.

* Write a simple program that prints the contents of a it-file. (maybe
  with GUI)

* Add support for Array<Mat<T> > and Array<Vec<T> > in load_it.m


RANDOM GENERATORS
=================

* Add possibility to change kernel generator.

* Implement bug-fixes in seed. See the home-page of
  Mersenne-Twister. Also change to BSD license.

* Speed-up in random number generator for Gaussian numbers? Some work
  has been done for 3.8.0 (Tony Ottosson)


GENERAL
=======

* Add support for stream versions of classes.

* Add functions and classes for optimization.


NEW MODULES
===========

* Make a m-file load/saver (similar to it-file).

* WCDMA blocks

* GSM/GPRS blocks

* IS95 blocks

* WLAN blocks
