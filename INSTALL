IT++ Installation
*****************

IT++ Requirements
=================

IT++ should compile without errors or warnings on most GNU/Linux systems
and on most other UNIX like systems like Solaris, Mac OS X, or Cygwin. It
is possible to compile IT++ on Windows NT/2000/XP using Microsoft's Visual
C++ .NET. For Linux, Unix, Cygwin and Mac OS X systems we assume that you
have at least the following GNU software installed on your computer:

  - GNU make, version 3.72.1 or later (to check version run `make
    --version')

  - GCC - GNU Compilers Collection (gcc, g++ and g77), version 3.3.x or
    later (to check version run `gcc --version')

Optionally, you might need additional tools like: Doxygen, LaTeX, Dvips
and Ghostscript to generate the HTML documentation.

We strongly recommend that you use well tested and stable releases of the
GCC compilers, i.e. 3.4.x, 3.3.x or 3.2.x, if possible. We do not actively
work on supporting older compilers and they may therefore (without prior
notice) become unsupported in future versions of IT++.

In order to use all functionality provided in the IT++ library it is
recommended that you have some external libraries compiled and installed
on your computer. The most important are FFTW, ATLAS (or CBLAS) and LAPACK
(optionally Intel Math Kernel Library as a replacement of these). It is
possible to compile and use IT++ without these libraries, but the
functionality will be reduced. We therefore recommend that you take some
time and effort to provide these external libraries in your system. Please
note, that some of them (FFTW, LAPACK) are usually included in the most
modern Linux distributions.


IT++ Configuration, Compilation and Installation
================================================

Since version 3.9.0, the IT++ library uses Autoconf/Automake tools for
configuration and Makefiles creation, so the compilation procedure
resembles a standard, well-known GNU method, i.e. 

  % ./configure
  % make

The `configure' command can be invoked with additional switches and
options (run `./configure --help' to get a list of them). The most
important are:

`--prefix=PREFIX'
    Set top installation directory to a certain PREFIX value. By default
    it is set to `/usr/local', so `make install' will install the
    package's files into `/usr/local/include', `/usr/local/lib`, etc.

`--enable-debug'
    Switch to DEBUG mode by setting additional debugging flags used by
    compiler and linker (disabled by default) 

`--enable-pedantic'
    Use even more debugging flags (disabled by default) 

`--disable-html-docs'
    Do not generate and install HTML documentation (enabled by default) 

`--with-cpu=CPU'
    Enable optimization flags for a specific CPU: `pentium3', `pentium4',
    `athlon-xp' or `sparc'. This option is only used by GCC.

By default, the `configure' script checks for a few external libraries
used by the IT++ library. These are: FFTW, ATLAS (CBLAS) and LAPACK. If
these libraries are found in your system, appropriate flags (i.e.
HAVE_FFTW, HAVE_CBLAS and HAVE_LAPACK) will be defined, and used during
the compilation and linking process.

If some of the external libraries are installed in a non-standard way in
your system, so they can not be detected by the `configure' script
automatically, you might use additional `--with-<LIBNAME>-dir' and
`--with-<LIBNAME>' switches, where <LIBNAME> is one of the following:
`fftw', `cblas' or `lapack'. For example:

  `--with-fftw-dir=/home/user/lib' will add `-L/home/user/lib' to the
    LDFLAGS environment variable, which is used during configuration and
    linking 
  
  `--with-fftw=-lfftw3' will extend the default LIBS variable with
    `-lfftw3' 

Please run `./configure --help' to obtain a full list of
`--with-<LIBNAME>-dir' and `--with-<LIBNAME>' switches available.

Optionally, instead of using `--with-<LIBNAME>-dir' switches you can set
LDFLAGS environment variable before executing `configure' command:

  % export LDFLAGS="-L/home/user/lib" 
  % ./configure --with-fftw="-lfftw3"

Although it is not recommended, you can intentionally prevent detection of
some external libraries. To do this, you should use `--without-<LIBNAME>'
or `--with-<LIBNAME>=no', e.g.:

  % ./configure --without-cblas --without-lapack

When the configuration process is finished a status message is briefly
presented. For instance, after having invoked the following configuration
command:

  % ./configure --enable-debug --with-cpu=pentium3

one can observe something like that:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now type 'make && make install' to build and install itpp-3.9.0 library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, it is time for compiling and linking the IT++ library. To do so,
please simply run the following command:

  % make

IT++ should compile without any errors or warnings. If this is not the
case, please submit a bug-report on the IT++ project page on SourceForge.
Please include information about your OS, compiler version, external
libraries and their versions, etc.

Finally, you should install the compiled and linked library, include files
and HTML documentation (optionally) by typing:

  % make install

Depending on the PREFIX settings during configuration, you might need the
root (administrator) access to success with this step.

Eventually, you might invoke the following command

  % make clean

to remove all files created during compilation process, or even

  % make distclean

to remove all files generated by the `configure' script.

Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.)

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).  Here is a another example:

     /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

Here the `CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash' operand causes subsequent
configuration-related scripts to be executed by `/bin/bash'.

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
