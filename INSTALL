IT++ Installation
*****************


IT++ Requirements
=================

IT++ should compile without errors or warnings on most GNU/Linux, BSD and
UNIX systems, and on POSIX based environments for Microsoft Windows like
Cygwin or MinGW with MSYS. It can be also built on Microsoft Windows NT/2000/
XP using Microsoft's Visual C++ .NET (or Express), but our support for this
compiler is limited. For GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris SunOS, Cygwin and MinGW
we assume that you have at least the following GNU software installed on your
computer:

  o GNU make, version 3.77 or later (check version with `make --version' or
    `gmake --version`)
  o GCC - GNU Compilers Collection including C (gcc) and C++ (g++) compilers,
    version 3.3.x or later (check version with `gcc --version')

In most cases, a Fortran compiler is also required for proper linking of IT++
with external BLAS and LAPACK libraries. GCC provides g77 (versions 3.x.x) or
gfortran (versions 4.x.x) compilers.

We strongly recommend that you use recent stable releases of the GCC, if
possible. We do not actively work on supporting older versions of the GCC,
and they may therefore (without prior notice) become unsupported in future
releases of IT++.

Instead of using GCC, you might try to build and link the IT++ library using
other C/C++/Fortran compilers. For instance, Intel C++ (icpc) and Fortran
(ifc) compilers are known to work well.

To perform tests, two command line programs: sed and diff are required.
Optionally, you might need a few additional programs, i.e. Doxygen, LaTeX,
Dvips and Ghostscript, to generate the HTML documentation. The HTML
documentation for each release is also available as separate packages for
download, so you do not need to generate it during the installation.

In order to use all functionality provided by the IT++ library, it is
recommended that you have some external libraries compiled and installed in
your computer. The basic set of them is: BLAS, LAPACK and FFTW (version 3.0.0
or later).

Instead of NetLib's reference BLAS and LAPACK implementations, some optimized
platform-specific libraries can be used as well, i.e.:

  o ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) - includes optimised
    BLAS and a limited set of LAPACK routines (version 3.6.0 or later)
  o MKL (Intel Math Kernel Library) - includes all required BLAS, LAPACK and
    FFT routines (version 8.1.1 or later; FFTW not required)
  o ACML (AMD Core Math Library) - includes BLAS, LAPACK and FFT routines
    (version 2.5.3 or later; FFTW not required)

Except the Intel MKL, the above mentioned BLAS/LAPACK implementations require
additional support libraries provided by a Fortran compiler. To use them with
IT++, please make sure that you have the compatible Fortran compiler
installed. For instance, if your system BLAS and LAPACK libraries were
compiled and linked with GNU g77, you should have the same compiler installed
on your system before starting the IT++ configuration process.

It is possible to compile and use IT++ without these external libraries, but
the functionality will be reduced. Therefore, we recommend that you take some
time and effort to provide these external libraries in your system. Please
note that the basic set of them (FFTW, BLAS and LAPACK) is usually included
in most modern Linux distributions.


Obtaining the IT++ Source Codes
===============================

IT++ is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and hence the
source code of the IT++ library is available for free download. To obtain the
IT++ source code, visit the project pages on SourceForge:

  o http://itpp.sourceforge.net/

and download the file named itpp-<VERSION>.tar.gz or itpp-<VERSION>.tar.bz2,
where <VERSION> is the latest release number, e.g. 4.0.0.


IT++ Configuration and Installation Instructions
================================================

Assuming that you have already downloaded the latest IT++ sources, untar and
unpack the sources, and enter the unpacked directory. Depending on the
package type you have downloaded, use the following commands:

  % gzip -cd itpp-<VERSION>.tar.gz | tar xf -
  % cd itpp-<VERSION>

  % bzip2 -cd itpp-<VERSION>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
  % cd itpp-<VERSION>

Since version 3.9.0, the IT++ library uses autoconf, automake and libtool for
preparing Makefiles and configuration script, so the compilation procedure
resembles a standard, well-known GNU method, i.e.

  % ./configure
  % make

The `configure' command can be invoked with additional switches and options
(run `./configure --help' to get a full list of them). The most important
are:

  o `--prefix=PREFIX' - set top installation directory to a certain PREFIX
    value. By default it is set to `/usr/local', so `make install' will
    install appropriate files into `/usr/local/include', `/usr/local/lib`,
    etc.
  o `--enable-debug' - build an extra library named `libitpp_debug.*' using
    special debugging flags for compiler and linker (disabled by default)
  o `--enable-exceptions' - enable exceptions handling of run-time errors
    instead of aborting the program (disabled by default)
  o `--disable-html-doc' - do not generate and install the HTML documentation
    (enabled by default)
  o `--disable-shared' - do not build the shared version of the library
    (enabled by default for non Windows based platforms)
  o `--disable-static' - do not build the static version of the library
    (enabled by default for Windows based platforms)

Plese note that each `--enable-<OPTION>' switch can be replaced with its
opposite switch `--disable-<OPTION>'.


Modularization
--------------

Since version 3.99.0, a modularization of the library has been introduced.
Therefore, several additional switches have been added to the configure
script, which can be used to disable building some of the library components.
Here is a list of them:

  o `--disable-comm' - do not build the `Communications' module
  o `--disable-fixed' - do not build the `Fixed-point' module
  o `--disable-optim' - do not build the `Numerical optimisations' module
  o `--disable-protocol' - do not include the `Protocols' module
  o `--disable-signal' - do not build the `Signal processing' module
  o `--disable-srccode' - do not build the `Source coding' module


External Libraries
------------------

By default, the `configure' script checks for a few external libraries, which
might be used by the IT++ library (cf. IT++ Requirements). The detection
procedure is as follows:

 1. First, the presence of a BLAS library among MKL, ACML, ATLAS and NetLib's
    reference BLAS is checked. If one of the above mentioned can be used,
    HAVE_BLAS is defined.

 2. Next, some LAPACK library is being searched, but only if BLAS is
    available. Full set of LAPACK routines can be found in the MKL, ACML and
    NetLib's reference LAPACK libraries. Besides, ATLAS contains a subset of
    optimised LAPACK routines, which can be used with NetLib's LAPACK library
    (this is described in the ATLAS documentation). If some LAPACK library
    can be found, HAVE_LAPACK is defined.

 3. Finally, a set of separate checks for FFT libraries is executed.
    Currently three different libraries providing FFT/IFFT routines can be
    used: MKL, ACML and FFTW. If at least one of them is found, HAVE_FFT id
    defined. Besides, one of the following: HAVE_FFT_MKL, HAVE_FFT_ACML or
    HAVE_FFTW3 is defined, respectively.

If some external libraries are installed in a non-standard location in your
system, e.g. MKL in `/opt/intel/mkl/9.1', the `configure' script will not
detect them automatically. In such a case, you should use LDFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS environment variables to define additional directories to be
searched for libraries (LDFLAGS) and include files (CPPFLAGS). For instance,
to configure IT++ to link to 32-bit versions of MKL 9.1 external libraries,
which is installed in `/opt/intel/mkl/9.1' directory, you should use the
following commands:

  % export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/intel/mkl/9.1/lib/32"
  % export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/intel/mkl/9.1/include"
  % ./configure

Instead of CPPFLAGS, one can use `--with-fft-include=<PATH>' configure option
to set path to header files that provide FFT functionality, i.e. to
`fftw3.h', `mkl_dft.h' or `acml.h'.

In the case that external libraries have non-standard names, e.g.
`libblas3.a' for BLAS, you might specify them to the configure using
`--with-<LIBNAME>' switches, where <LIBNAME> is one of the following:
`blas', `lapack' or `fft'. You might use more than one library names by
quoting them, e.g.

  % ./configure --with-blas="-latlas -lblas"

If there is only one library specified, you can use a simplified notation
without the preceding `-l', e.g. `--with-fft=fftw3' instead of `--with-fftw=
-lfftw3'.

Please refer to the documentation of your external libraries, to find out
what are the correct library names and paths on your architecture, operating
system, etc.

Since IT++ 4.0.3 release, the configure script provides a new `--with-zdotu=
<method>' option. It can be used to change the default calling convention of
BLAS zdotu_ Fortran function. The BLAS libraries built with g77 compiler do
not return the complex result of a function, but pass it via the first
argument of the function. The implementations compiled with gfortran and
other vendor compilers return complex result as a typical function. By using
a `void' method with the `--with-zdotu=<method>' option, the former approach
is used (g77 compatible). To use the zdotu_ call that returns the result by
value, a `complex' method should be passed. Without setting any of the two
methods explicitly, IT++ tries to guess the proper method based on the
detected BLAS implementation. Otherwise, a Fortran wrapper function
zdotusub_ is used, which requires a working Fortran compiler. Finally, if
this is not the case, the zdotu_ BLAS method is not used at all and a
relevant warning message is displayed during the configuration step.

Although it is not recommended, you can intentionally prevent detection of
some external libraries. To do this you should use `--without-<LIBNAME>' or
`--with-<LIBNAME>=no', e.g.:

  % ./configure --without-blas --without-lapack


Optimisation Flags
------------------

It is recommended to set the CXXFLAGS environment variable with some
compiler- and platform-specific optimisation flags, before invoking the
`configure' command. Additionally, `-DNDEBUG' should be included in the
optimised CXXFLAGS, because it turns off all conditional assertion checks.
This will improve the computation performance of many IT++ functions.For
example, in the case of using the Intel Pentium 4 processor one might employ
the following flags:

  % CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3 -march=pentium4 -pipe" ./configure

In the case of Sun's UltraSPARC 64-bit platform and GCC compiler, the flags
might be set as follows:

  % export CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O3 -mcpu=v9 -m64 -pipe"
  % ./confiugre

If CXXFLAGS is not set in the environment, it will be initialised with the
default flags, i.e. "-DNDEBUG -O3 -pipe".


Configuration Status
--------------------

When the configuration process is finished, a status message is displayed.
For instance, after having invoked the following configuration command

  % ./configure --with-blas="-lblas"

on a recent Gentoo Linux system with blas-atlas, lapack-atlas and fftw
packages installed, one can observe something like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now type 'make && make install' to build and install itpp-4.0.3 library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Compilation
-----------

Now, it is time for compiling and linking the IT++ library. To do so, please
simply run the following command:

  % make

IT++ should compile without any errors or warnings. If this is not the case,
please report the problem on the IT++ Help forum at SourceForge. Please
include information about your OS, compiler version, external libraries and
their versions, etc.


Testing the Compiled Library
----------------------------

It is recommended that you check if your library has been compiled and linked
properly and works as expected. To do so, you should execute the testing
process:

  % make check

As a result, you should obtain a similar report:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `array_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `bessel_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `window_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `histogram_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test `stat_test' PASSED.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check if all the executed tests PASSED. If not, please report the problem on
the IT++ Help forum.


Installation
------------

Finally, you should install the compiled and linked library, include files
and HTML documentation (optionally) by typing:

  % make install

Depending on the PREFIX settings during configuration, you might need the
root (administrator) access to perform this step.

Eventually, you might invoke the following command

  % make clean

to remove all files created during compilation process, or even

  % make distclean

to remove all files generated by the `configure' script.
